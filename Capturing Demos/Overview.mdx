The first step of creating an interactive demo with Fable is capturing using [Fable’s Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fable-create-interactive/ekmabenadlgfkjplmpldkjkhiikobaoc)

## Fable’s Chrome Extension

Fable’s Chrome extension lets you capture any browser based application and auto-stitches it into an interactive demo based on the actions you undertake at the time of capture.

You can install the extension by following the steps below:

<iframe 
   style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", height: "60vh" }} 
   width="100%" 
   height="100%" 
   src="https://app.sharefable.com/p/demo/fable-documentation_in-mhkqfxxa21wt1217" 
   allowFullScreen
></iframe>

## HTML Demo Capture

With Fable’s Chrome extension, you can do an HTML capture of any browser based application. Each element of the capture can be made interactive and every aspect of the demo is customizable as per your requirements. In this section we will dive into how the capture process looks like.

Once you have installed the extension, go to the next page to see how to use the extension.
