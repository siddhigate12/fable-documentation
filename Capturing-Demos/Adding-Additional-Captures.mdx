In cases where you want to add additional captures to an existing demo, you can easily achieve that by selecting the ‘Save in an existing demo’ option after capturing the steps.

## How to Add Additional Captures to an Existing Demo

As before, you can go to your web page/application and capture the additional steps that you want to add to an existing demo by firing up the extension. Once the capture process is done, at the time of selecting where you want these captures to be added, select ‘Save in an existing demo’ option. The interactive demo below will guide you through the steps.

After you have all the steps that you want captured and added to a demo, you can edit everything from the messages, to the look and feel of the demo to adding cool effects within the demo. The next section of Editing Demos will dive deeper into it.
